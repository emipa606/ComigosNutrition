  <!-- EN: An ancient but untouched machine previously gifted to some advanced colony. It somehow manipulates food matter in weird ways to extract all the minerals, vitamins, and proteins into a meal, consuming ridiculously low amount of matter. A red eye seems to scan humanoids to provide a balanced meal designed for each particular user. If you look inside, you can see how food matter flows — or flies?! — and reforms into a green… disgusting… paste. Consumes a questionable amount of power. -->
